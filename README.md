# hello-world
This is a practice repository for use in ENG 517

Here is a list of my on-going questions about GitHub

1. Can I set up multiple projects or teams that work on parts of a project and each control their own repo? Then merge the repos? 

2. How to do collaboration between parts of a large, emergent project?

3. How do you work on files of different specialized file types (e.g., DITA files)?

4. How do you add members of a team to a repo?
